                the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and
                aerospace engineering. <br><br> He spent the next four decades as a
                scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
                Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space
                Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
                India's civilian space programme and military missile
                development efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man
                of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile
                and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal
                organisational, technical, and political role in India's
                Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
                nuclear test by India in 1974. <br />

                Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with
                the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
                then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as
                the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of
                education, writing and public service after a single term. He
                was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the
                Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. <br />
